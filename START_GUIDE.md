# 🚀 Start Your Forum Application

## Backend + Frontend Integration Complete! ✅

The React frontend is now connected to the Django backend and will display real data from the database.

## 📋 What's Connected:

### Categories Section
- ✅ Fetches categories from `/api/categories/`
- ✅ Displays real topic counts
- ✅ Shows icons, titles, and descriptions from database

### Topics Section  
- ✅ Fetches latest topics from `/api/topics/`
- ✅ Shows real author names with avatars
- ✅ Displays actual reply counts
- ✅ Calculates time ago dynamically

### Sidebar
- ✅ Fetches top members by points from `/api/profiles/top_members/`
- ✅ Shows popular topics sorted by reply count
- ✅ Displays real user data

## 🎯 Start Both Servers:

### Terminal 1 - Backend (Django):
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python manage.py runserver
```
Server will start at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Terminal 2 - Frontend (React):
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
Server will start at: `http://localhost:3000`

## ✨ What You'll See:

1. **Real Categories** - 4 categories with actual topic counts
2. **Real Topics** - 7 forum topics from your database
3. **Real Users** - 7 users with their profiles, avatars, and points
4. **Live Data** - All data is fetched from Django REST API

## 🔧 API Endpoints Being Used:

- `GET http://localhost:8000/api/categories/` - Forum categories
- `GET http://localhost:8000/api/topics/` - All topics
- `GET http://localhost:8000/api/profiles/top_members/` - Top users by points

## 🎨 Features:

- Loading states while fetching data
- Error handling if backend is not running
- Automatic time formatting (e.g., "2hr ago")
- Dynamic reply counts from database
- Real user avatars and points

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**If you see "Failed to load categories/topics":**
1. Make sure Django backend is running on port 8000
2. Check that CORS is configured (already done ✅)
3. Verify database has data: `python manage.py populate_data`

**CORS Already Configured:**
- Backend allows requests from `http://localhost:3000`
- No additional configuration needed

Your forum is fully connected and ready to display real data! 🎉
